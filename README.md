# Automated Lexical Simplification of Hindi Text

The need for lexical simplification arises from the necessity for making content and products accessible to a wide range of individuals, regardless of their abilities. In today's context, accessible technology holds greater significance in fostering inclusivity. Beyond improving the lives of those with impairments, accessible content benefits both, people with impairments and people without impairments. Accessibility pertains to both the tools the researcher use and the content the researcher consume, with a significant aspect being comprehension. Failure to comprehend content can lead to financial losses, accidents, dissatisfaction, and disinterest. Clear instructions are extremely crucial, as their absence has led to accidents. Edward Lee Thorndike noted that readers lose interest when they do not understand the meaning of a word. Legal documents often exemplify this issue. Therefore, plain language, involving simple, comprehensible language, is key for effective communication.

The Plain Language Movement, which began in the 1970s in the United States, aimed to make regulations understandable. This movement spread to various fields and languages. Researchers worldwide strive to make text understandable. It is vital to simplify publicly accessible content for a diverse audience. With the evolving field of natural language processing, the field of text simplification has evolved significantly over the years. Textual content can be simplified in various ways, such as lexical simplification, which substitutes complex words with simpler synonyms, while retaining the context. Lexical simplification is invaluable for people who are unfamiliar with a language, persons with language difficulties, non-native speakers, individuals with low literacy, and children. The researcher explored lexical simplification across languages, noting the need for a bibliometric study to gauge the quantity of work, its diversity, and collaborative efforts made in this field.

Despite the widespread use of Hindi, lexical simplification efforts in the language are limited.
The stages of lexical simplification include complex word identification, synonym generation, word sense disambiguation, and synonym ranking. The research aims to identify complex word features, employ a knowledge-based approach for word sense disambiguation, and generate simpler synonyms for the target complex word.

The researcher created a corpus for dataset development, analyzed readability formulae and word lists for relevant features, and incorporated word embeddings. Word sense disambiguation was performed using sense embeddings and human annotation.

This studyâ€™s contributions encompass insights into the lexical simplification needs of native and non-native Hindi speakers, an aesthetics corpus, a stop lemma list, a dataset with lexical features, and innovative approaches to complex word identification, dataset creation, and word sense disambiguation.
The research identifies the effectiveness of stop lemmas, presents a publicly available aesthetics corpus, and emphasizes the importance of frequency, syllables, and hyponyms in determining word complexity. The researcher developed a complex word identification model, combining linguistic knowledge and machine learning techniques. The findings underscore the need for delving deeper into personalised lexical simplification, utilising sense embeddings for Hindi word sense disambiguation, and devising readability metrics tailored to Hindi.

This study contributes to enhancing language accessibility, communication efficiency, and NLP applications for Hindi speakers. Extensions of this research could include exploring alternative complex word labeling strategies and model fine-tuning.
